    <blockquote>
      <p>“First off, location, location, location!
        The Hotel Virgat in Manali is located in a wonderfully picturesque
        part of town, and in the lap of snow-filled mountains.
        The staff were polite and friendly, and the neighborhood
        really did feel welcoming. I even ended up extending my stay, and the
        hotel staff made all the arrangements! Can't wait to make my way out to the Virgat's again.” </p>

      <p>“The Hotel Virgat in Mumbai is a great place to stay if you're
        looking to be in the heart of the city, and can’t afford to break the bank.
        The front desk staff were always helpful, and made
        checking in and out a pleasurable experience. The room’s modern decor
        and extra amenities were the icing on the cake. Thank You!”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Me and my Friends enjoyed our stay here. The hotel staffs are approachable
        and accommodating and they welcome us so warm. We really like how they value
        their guest/s as their families, and we feel it with their smile in their faces
        even its midnight already. The room was good as well as the service, we really
        had a good time staying at your hotel and will definitely recommend it with our
        friends and family. Good job! Hope we see us again. Thank you!”</p>
